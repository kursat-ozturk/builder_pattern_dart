# builder_pattern_dart

Builder pattern is one of the creational design patterns. This pattern allows creating complex objects in a simple and understandable way. Builder pattern separates the object's structure and representation, making the same construction process usable for different representations. This way, the object creation process is performed step by step and the desired features can be selected.
